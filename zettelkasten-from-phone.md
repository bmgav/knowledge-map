## Reading Habits: Putting It All Together

- learning is about coverage, practice and insight -- writing about what you read helps to reveal the gaps in your understanding
- coverage is mostly about reading techniques -- more specifically how to most efficiently takes notes
- reading can be split into 2 stages
  - collecting - want to be fast and generate a lot of intermediate products to work with later
    - highlighting and/or writing notes in the margin means you'll always need to physical copy -- instead write down interesting parts immediately, on a separate piece of paper, in your own words
  - processing - combine notes into clusters before adding to zettelkasten -- helps you think about text as a whole
- the more you know about a subject, the longer it takes to integrate material into your zettelkasten -- integrating material will eventually become your bottleneck

## Stop Relying on a Source and Have Faith in your own Thoughts

- it's impossible to capture 100% coverage of the information in a source (unless you're the author) -- you can't know for sure what the authors intent was
- Notes that you write yourself are more inline with your own thought patterns, thus making them easier to remember -- plus they're also easier to make sense of if/when you re-read them
- raw data needs to be filtered through the brain for it to become actual information -- there is a finite amount of things that your conscious mind can focus on at a given time, your brain does a good job of filtering out the stuff that historically/naturally/previously haven't been important (in a given situation)
  - based on this it's plausible that 'information' doesn't exist at all in a text, the information is only created once it passes through the filter of your brain
- Your own ideas are the most important things to capture when reading ... everything else can be recreated from the original source if necessary

## The Barbell Reading Method

- when reading we want to balance 2 separate demands/goals:
  - want to read a lot (to have a high influx of information)
  - want to direct our efforts at the best sources (and invest minimal time/attention towards low quality sources)
- Based on these 2 goals, there are 2 common traps people fall into:
  - increase reading speed -- results in never processing texts and never gaining knowledge
  - read everything carefully -- wastes a lot of time on bad texts
