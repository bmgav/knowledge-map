# Interview Prep

One of the main reasons why I originally wanted to start putting together/using a knowledge map was that every time I would have a technical interview, I would find myself trying to quickly re-learn the same topics I had tried to quickly learn the previous time I had an interview

In my most recent interview, there were several areas I needed to study:

- general CS knowledge
  - algorithms/data structures
  - python syntax
- networks
- operating systems
  - specifically knowing the internals of the Linux os
  - additionally knowing how to troubleshoot various issues on a Linux system
- System design

Across all of these fairly broad categories, I felt somewhat overwhelmed by the amount of possible information there was to learn. I unfortunately ended up focusing way to much of my time trying to make sure that I had collected sources of information which were comprehensive (even though I didn't even know what that meant at the time, and realize now that I could never actually know), instead of focusing on actually learning and understanding the sources I did have. A lot of the motivation behind beginning this knowledge-map is to not make that mistake again, and go back and actually learn from the sources of information I had compiled

### Essential knowledge for interviews can be broken into 3 categories

| Data-Structures | Algorithms | Concepts |
| --------------- | ---------- | -------- |
| Arrays | Merge Sort | Big O Time |
| Hash Tables | Quick Sort | Big O Space |
| Trees (& Tries) | BFS | Recursion |
| Graphs | DFS | Memorization |
| Stacks & Queues | Binary Search | Dynamic Programming |
| Heaps |

### Behavioral

- prepare a 2 minute pitch about yourself
- focus of your successes -- guide your interviewer towards things you want to talk about
  - if you have any technical hobbies definitely talk about them
  - pick at least 1 (preferably 2) projects to talk about -- be prepared to talk about your challenges, architecture, tradeoffs, mistakes, successes, motivation
    - also be prepared to talk about the softer skills/experience -- leadership, be open about mistakes
- Be passionate, knowledgeable, and be a good teammate

### Design Questions

- What would you do at work? (WWYDAW)
- SKIR -- Scope, Key Components, Identify Issue, Repairs
  - Scope - ask questions, make appropriate associations
  - Define key components - can be somewhat na√Øve (doesn't need to be fully flushed out)
  - Identify issues - bottlenecks, tradeoffs
  - repair/redesign
- generally talk/think top down approach
- Want to make sure you're leading the process, but also want to be open to feedback from your interviewer
- How to prepare
  - read about designs used by major companies (think don't memorize)
  - know the key concepts (tasks, caches, REST, sharding, webstack)
  - practice back of the envelop calculations

### Algorithm Questions

#### Big O Refresher

Example 1:

```python
for i in range(N):
  for j in range(i, N):
    # checks half the options (N^2/2) but still O(N^2)
```

Example 2:

```python
for i in range(len(A)):   # loop over all elements in A
  for j in range(len(B)): # Loop over all element in B
    # most people answer N^2 because of the nested for loop ...
    # ... but what would N be ? ...
    # correct answer is O(A*B)
```

#### Solving Algorithms

1. Listen for clues
2. Draw an example
3. Brute force
4. Optimize
   1. B.U.D. -- look for Bottlenecks, Unnecessary work, and duplicated work
   2. Consider space/time trade-offs (consider hash tables and/or precomputation)
   3. Do it yourself
   4. Base case and build (Recursion)
5. Walk-Through
6. Write beautiful code
7. Test your code
