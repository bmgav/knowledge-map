## Random Thoughts

Reflecting on my learning habits over the past 1-2 weeks I've noticed a few reaccuring issues:

- At the moment it's not only hard, but actually impossible to add notes to my archive from my phone
  - Beyond this, I haven't figured out the best way to flag/bookmark articles from my newsfeed/general web surfing as ones that are worth actually reading. One of the issues here is what seems like a contradiction between wanting to filter articles using my phone and wanting the filtering process to involve skimming an article but note the parts/paragraphs that seemed interesting yet not having a way to mark places in articles from my phone
- Thus far I've found it difficult to read an article on my laptop and take notes at the same time (also on my laptop) when I'm not at my desk with multiple monitors
  - Sitting at my desk starts to feel impractical after an amount of time either because my back starts hurting, or in the evenings/weekends it feels particularly anti-social (even though realistically it's not much different than sitting on the couch with my laptop)
- I've definitely continued the habit of reading all/most of an article before deciding whether or not I think it will be useful -- I defintely need to find a way to narrow this down
  - similarly, because I'm still spending the majority of my time filtering, my reading list has continued to grow, at times causing me to be unsure of where to start when I do finally sit down to process some of my inbox/reading list
- I think an overarching problem is that I don't have a super specific goal in mind. This combined with the fact that my knowledge map work is basically unrelated to my actual job, plus the fact that even the loose goals I do have don't fully fit into the framework laid out for using a zettelkasten as a thinking/writing tool.

Based on the above thoughts, I think the following are good ideas to try to address some of the issues:

1. Having an actual goal -- thus far I've been working with the fuzzy goal of capturing information/knowledge useful for preparing for technical interviews, combined with the general idea of longer-term and/or lasting learning/knowledge generation. The problem with this fuzzy goal is that thus far (perhaps because I'm still getting started) I've struggled to cut down both the time I spend filtering articles, and the number of articles that make it on to my reading list. I think it's worth noting that some of this comes from me not knowing exactly what I want my career to be, so I find myself wanting to learn about all of the topics surround cs and software, which isn't realistic in general, but certainly not in a short-term timeframe. Perhaps defining priorities of what I want to learn about for interviews would help. Another issue is I've struggled to know where the line is on what to capture/write down when it comes to information that I've learned before (sometimes it's clear that it's already ingrained, others its clear that I need to refresh myself and should write it down, but other times I find it hard to tell if the information is something I truely know, or if reading about it just sparks memories). As I'm writing this, and thinking about it more, I think it makes sense to capture information if there's any doubt at all, though I think what's kept me from doing that is my impatience surrounding wanting to learn new stuff now/quickly, yet realistically that's not really how learning in general works, and its certainly not how maintaining a zettelkasten works.
2. Starting with smaller goals that are actually attainable (at least while I'm adjusting to maintaining a zettelkasten, but also probably in general).
3. Set aside specific times for knowledge work -- implementing number 2 is important here, because if the goals I'm trying to reach are unrealistic, I'll end up feeling like only using the alloted time isn't enough to make significant progress. Realistically though the opposite of this is what I'm currently doing, which is constantly feeling like I want/need to be productive and yet never/rarely actually getting anything done (often because I don't know where to start or don't want to actually engage my brain)
4. Following up on the previous item, I think it's also important to set aside times to simply relax and not worry about being productive (either knowledge work, personal coding projects, work, etc), and genuinely give my brain a break so I can feel refreshed more often.

## Raw and/or Buffer Notes

I'm still pretty new to the idea of knowledge maps/second brains/zettelkasten so I'm not entirely sure what the best way to structure all of this is, so for now I'm going to add a few notes/thoughts here and intend on moving them elsewhere when I know where they should go:

## The Collector's Fallacy

While reading a blog post on Zettlekasten the other day, the idea of the Collector's Fallacy seemed to resonate with me. The main point of the blog was to explain that collecting sources of information (without processing them) not only isn't helpful, but can actually be detrimental if your collection becomes so large that it is intimidating. This idea/concept resonated with me because I have definitely fallen into a pattern of collecting various sources of information as bookmarks and the most frequent result is for me to never look at the bookmark again. One of the main points the blog post made was that information needs to be processed (typically in the form of taking notes in your own words) before it actually becomes part of your knowledge. The flip side of this is that letting your inbox/collection of sources become too large often leads to never actually extracting the knowledge from the sources. To handle this issue, one must find a way to limit the size of their information inbox (essentially either by being more selective about what makes it into the inbox, or by processing the sources in your inbox more frequently, or both)

What's interesting is that I read the above mentioned blog post no more than 3-4 days ago, and yet I realized that I already forgot a decent amount of it as I was just trying to type up a summary of it. This does seem to drive home the idea that until you actually process information and/or actively use it somehow it won't be a part of your knowledge. The take away from this idea is one that I hadn't ever actually considered, despite knowing about the idea itself to some extent. The take away is that reading without taking notes is essentially a waste of time (because you will eventually forget what you read, which leads to 1 of 2 options, either you never use the information again, in which case why did you spend time reading to begin with, or alternatively if you do need the information in the future, you'll have to re-read at least part of the original source, essentially making the first reading a waste of time). I forget if the article pointed this out or not, but it seems clear to me that this idea only really applies to knowledge-based reading (i.e. it wouldn't apply to reading a fictional book which you are reading purely because you like to read)

Taking notes thoroughly means you are able to rely on your notes alone, and rarely (if ever) need to look up details in original texts. Having a text at hand does nothing to increase your knowledge.

One way to combat the habit/instinct to collect sources of information is to keep the cycle of research, reading and knowledge assimilation short
- train yourself to process 'photocopied' texts soon, gives us a feeling of how much we can really handle
- each full cycle from research to knowledge assimilation means we've learned more about the topic -- with this knowledge our research gets more efficient

To start more from the beginning, the above mentioned blog post is part of a larger blog series on the topic of Zettlekasten, the following are notes from the [Introductory Blog](https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/):

- In general Zettlekasten is a method for how to deal with knowledge throughout your life
  - Like any skill, it takes practice to get used to and/or better at
  - It is a tool for thinking and writing -- hypertext features make creating a web of thoughts possible (which is the main distinction from other knowledge systems)
- zettlekasten is a significant improvement over standard note taking approaches -- it amplifies effectiveness
  - improves connectivity of thoughts -- connections between ideas make finding new insights possible
  - even if you don't use notes you've taken in the immediate future, you would have still prepared the knowledge for future projects
  - helps you to be able to tackle more complex problems -- allows you to focus on a small part of a problem and after take a step back and look at the panorama view
  - Scales much better than normal note taking over time
  - people tend to have a limited capacity for following a single line of thought for a long period of time -- zettelkasten will help you keep you thoughts alive and help you hold on to them

The 3 most important properties of a zettelkasten:
- It's hyper-textual - texts that refer to each other and explain or expand on the information in others
  - The emphasis put on forming relationships makes it such that connecting (instead of collecting) is the priority
- It adheres to the Principle of Atomicity  -- each zettel only contains one unit of knowledge (most often each zettel is a single thought)
- It is personal -- there is 1 zettelkasten per person, and one person per zettelkasten

Each zettel should have 3 components:
1. a unique ID
2. the body of the zettel -- this contains whatever you want to capture, the knowledge
   - most important aspect of the body is that it's written in your own words -- your zettelkasten will truely be yours if it contains your own content (and not just a collection of other peoples thoughts)
   - limiting the scope of each zettel to a single thought allows your zettelkasten to help you think (instead of just assisting in creating excerpts for example)
   - want to capture knowledge instead of just information -- should always make something from the information you process, i.e. should always translate information to knowledge by adding context and relevance
   - when debating whether or not to take/create a note, when in doubt write the note, in the confines of your deadline -- any knowledge added could potentially be useful at some future time (perhaps unrelated to why you took the note)
     - Need to compromise between broad note taking and focusing on current projects/tasks/work -- i.e. you can't take random notes on anything you're interested in and expect to get anything done
     - The amount of deviation you should allow depends on what you deadline is
     - The decision to work focused on projects vs allowing deviation isn't necessarily directly related to zettelkasten -- it's more related to the circumstances of your life
3. references -- at the bottom you either reference the source of the knowledge (or leave it blank if you capture you own thoughts)
    - recommended software on windows to manage bibliographies is [jabref](https://www.jabref.org/)

Connecting Zettel
- when you relate pieces of knowledge, you create relationships -- knowledge relationships improve recall and also help your mind see patterns
- When making connections, always state the context (i.e. state explicitly why you made the link)
  - without link context your future self won't know why he should follow a link

Structure Notes
- Adding some sort of hierarchical structure to your zettelkasten can be very useful
  - increases potential for knowledge creation and helps you to see the bigger picture
- A structure note is a zettel about other zettels -- serve as fast tracks to navigate through the web of notes
- A single zettel can be linked to from multiple structure notes

Notes About Individual Zettel Layout
- the ID of the zettel is both in the filename and in the contents of the file
- using a time-based ID can be helpful as it never changes -- this allows you to change the title of notes without breaking any links
- tags can be denoted using hashtags -- clicking on a hashtag should perform a search for the tag

## Learn Faster with Zettel Notes
- Drilldown Method consists of 3 stages:
    1. coverage - use efficient reading techniques to drill through texts quickly -- the general idea is to skim the material before diving in, the following steps could be used:
       1. Look over the headlines (to get a feeling for the structure)
       2. Decide what you want to know after reading the text
       3. Quickly look at the paragraphs to get a sense of what is in each section
       4. Mark/take note of paragraphs/sections you find useful -- don't take elaborate notes, just flag them for actually reading
    2. practice - takes notes and test whether you understand what the text contains
       1. after getting the overview of a topic, you have to understand it to be able to actually learn it -- deepening your understanding of a topic is largely based on the following 2 things:
          1. Making connections
          2. Debugging errors -- this can also be thought of as getting the information out of the text, process is:
             1. re-read passages marked as interesting (only read passages if you're positive that they contain knowledge you want to keep)
             2. take notes -- search for statements which caught your attention or got you thinking -- compacting key statements will challenge you intellectually every time (this challenge is how you create lasting knowledge)
    3. insight - integrate the notes into your note archive to create lasting knowledge
       1. Making connections between notes allows the knowledge to be accessible after your brain forgets the specific contents of a note
       2. Notes should be based on concepts (instead of strictly following the structure of a text)
       3. You may find similar concepts in different texts -- you can either merge the concepts into a single note, or write about the relationship between the texts in a separate note
       4. It's important to see connections between your notes, and it's important that the connections make sense to you (though it doesn't matter if they make sense to someone else)

## The difference between good and bad tags

There are 2 types of tags:
1. Tags for topics -- group notes under a topic
2. Tags for objects -- used to group notes around an object (real or conceptual)

When you are working on a particular topic, you are typically working across a number of concepts (here concepts are better used as tags than topics)

Broad, general connections (which is often the case when tagging/connecting based on topics) tend not to be useful in the long run -- tags for objects are much more precise and help reveal real connections

[reference](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/object-tags-vs-topic-tags/)

## Why Categories are a Bad Idea

- when starting, don't prepare by inventing categories, instead just let them come/emerge naturally
- Maintaining your note archive without categories (at least imposed categories from the beginning) allows it to better suit/match the way you think.
- Predefined categories are too rigid (often built once and then used forever) -- notes will have to fit the structure of the categories or we'll have to compromise in some way -- often this means breaking up and/or replacing the categories, but this isn't how our brain works at all (when we learn something new, we don't have to switch something out to make room)
- Topic clusters should emerge (over time) naturally, particularly surrounding keywords or tags -- this allows the categories that emerge to do so based on your interests

[reference](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/no-categories/)

## What are buffer notes?

- container for/grouping of notes that you will use later -- buffer the gap between when you take notes and when you assign them to a project (or otherwise add them to your note archive)
- essentially a means to store notes relevant to a project in an unstructured manner

[reference](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/buffer-notes/)

## A Tale of Complexity - Structural Layers In Note Taking

- There are 3 layers which typically emerge in a zettelkasten as it grows
  - Bottom layer: Content - starting out only having content notes with tags makes sense, but will eventually be hard to manage
    - Hub-type notes are one option as your zettelkasten grows, but these too become hard to maintain
  - Middle Layer: Structure Notes - structure lists are essentially a table of contents
    - structure notes and tags both point to groups of notes, though structure notes add an element of structure, making the archive of notes easier to use
  - Top Layer: Main Structure Notes and Double Hashes - top level structure notes which mainly structure sets of other structure notes
    - top level notes can be marked with a double-hash tag (i.e. `##self-worth`)
- Does the software you use provide easy, scalable access to the 3 layers described above? -- one sign that it doesn't is the use of project folders  (or any folders for that matter). Folders are a way to limit the complexity of the contents to a single topic/project, yet the most productive way to generate knowledge is often the interdisciplinary part (meaning that each topic/project shouldn't be isolated in its own folder)
- The software you use to maintain your zettelkasten can influence the way you work -- one reason people end up reverting to using folders is that their system doesn't properly handle the 3 structural layers -- this removes the opportunity to create something that is bigger than a single project

## Making Proper Marks in Books

- marks should be used to aid understanding (in a later phase of reading) -- highlighting or underlining doesn't help you remember at all
- Typically want to mark passages for future reference -- can be done in pencil (and erased if you don't own the book), or you could use colored pencils if preferred and you own the book
- Collection phase can consist of putting marks in the margins of the book as well as writing out notes in a separate location
  - Can simply put a dot in the margin which will help you find the passage when you are processing the text
  - It makes more sense to capture a summary (or unique thought) inspired from the passage in a separate location vs in the margins of the book
- For academic reading, can use a slightly more complex marking scheme
  - circle terms when they are defined (and write 'D' in the margin)
  - when the author elaborates a model, put an M in the margin, maybe highlight key terms
  - Put an 'A' in the margin when the author makes an argument
  - Put a bolt glyph in the margin any time you find a weakness in an argument, or one you disagree with

## Reading for the Zettelkasten is Searching

It quickly becomes clear that it's not obvious waht to include in your note archive and what to leave out.

Item types to search for when reading for our Zettelkasten (helps prevent you from being distracted by parts of the text that are unrelated to why you're reading it):
- Theories - networks of statements which aim to generate statements on the reality.
- Models - Representations of reality
- Definitions - define terms, which are meant to be building blocks of a model or theory
- Arguments - connect a premise and a conclusion -- consists of 3 elements:
  - premise
  - conclusion
  - operator
- Counterarguments - aim to destroy an argument (typically target the truth of the premises or the validity of the connection)
- Facts - things that really are the case and/or occurred -- what you count as a fact depends on what you're willing to accept without any reason or evidence

## Note-Taking When Reading The Web/RSS

Collector's fallacy should be combated with good knowledge management habits -- but how should we deal with the amount of information on the internet in an efficient way that allows us to keep up to date and conserve information without getting overwhelmed

Steps to get from stuff to reference material:

- Filter interesting information (collect useful pieces only, and create a reading list to review routinely)
- After finding what's useful, take note of it (taking notes ensures you actually expand your knowledge)
- Process the notes you took -- integrate them into you knowledge system

The above process can be applied to various forms of potential information:

- stuff - posts/links from social media, RSS feeds, and pages stumbled upon when casually browsing the web.
- inbox - holds items we either want to or need to pay attention to (a lot of stuff never reaches our inbox) -- the web pages we want to keep end up making up our reading list
- reference items - 

RSS subscriptions are not part of your inbox (in fact it's no different than the rest of the internet) -- you need to decide what you want to have knowledge about (and what is irrelevant)
- RSS feed items can be seen mainly as a source of information you skim and from which you pick useful items to populate your reading list

Suggestions for dealing with streams of input like RSS:

- skim the material briefly -- quickly decide what you want to do with the material
  - reading articles eventually becomes the bottleneck -- reading an item in full in your RSS reader should only be done for entertainment
  - skim articles in your RSS feed, get a quick overview, then decide if you want to keep it
- decide if it's information you want to keep, if so you need to actually process it -- start by adding it to your reading list (also be sure to process your reading list routinely)
- if it's collectible, like a recipe or a recommendation for cool products, put it on a reference list

If/when your list of unread items becomes longer than you'd like, the goal is to empty it as quickly as possible (so you don't become overwhelmed by the size of the queue)

Smartphones are great for filtering (but not for processing) -- phone can be used to filter web pages onto your reading list (which can actually be processed from your computer)

## The Two Forms of Zettel

Zettel can come in 2 forms:
1. The outer form - refers to entities that are necessary for its existance
   1. The identifier of a zettel gives it separateness (uniqueness in a perfect world), and the possibility of connection -- having an identifier is the condition of existance for a zettel
   2. since a necessary condition for zettel is the uniqueness of its id, you should guarantee said uniqueness for every note
2. the inner form - refers to entities the compose its inner structure
   1. inner structure of a zettel contains 2 entities:
      1. meta data - information about the zettel itself
      2. content

[reference](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/zettel-nature-two-forms/)

## Using Short Knowledge Cycles

- to ensure we are making progress, need to be able to stay on track and handle interruptions and breaks well -- using short knowledge cycles will help accomplish this.
- knowledge cycle composed of the following steps -- note that each cycle is driven by feedback from the previous ones:
  - research new material (scan and select what's useful vs. what isn't)
  - read the findings (increasing our temporary understanding based on our short-term memory)
  - take notes to feed into our zettelkasten (permanantly increasing our knowledge)
  - write - add a new section or add notes to the outline of an existing draft
    - note that I'm not entirely sure this part directly applies to me as I'm not a writer, though this could be the section where I actually write code
- short knowledge cycles help to answer the question "are we actually moving towards the goal?" on a regular basis -- we are busy (and often feel productive) doing research, but doing research for long periods of time tends to lead away from our actual goals, regularly checking in (by completing the other parts of the knowledge cycle) keeps us on track
  - research can become addictive because it rewards us with a false impression of making progress (this impression of making progress is essentially the basis for the collector's fallacy)
- A lot of people are hesistant to take even short breaks from their work, but doing so helps you to remain fresh -- often times taking a short break (2-5 minutes) doesn't even take your thoughts away from your work, but it gives your brain a slightly different context which can be helpful
- Note that this essentially describes the pomodoro technique (though the article author suggested slightly different amounts of time)
- another way to describe this idea is iterative writing (or in general working iteratively) -- using shorter cycles allows you to better judge what is going to be useful in the next cycle
- a lot of the uneasyness that often comes when starting this method stems from being uncertain about being able to pick up where you left off -- if this is the case it will help to establish a way of leaving notes/instructions to your future self so you can jump back in
- Relates back to the concept of the collector's fallacy -- using a shorter cycle of going through all of the steps forces you to process you reading list often, therefore/hopefully preventing you from piling up a reading list to the point where it's intimidating
- to form any habit, need to have actionable goals and boundaries + keep record of our progress -- To create a routine for short knowledge cycles:
  1. Start with 1 hour of research
  2. process all of your findings from step 1 -- take notes and connect them in your zettelkasten (+ do whatever it takes to really integrate the new findings into your knowledge)
  3. reflect on the process -- how did you do? did you learn something new? was the amount of material manageable? How long did it take to process your findings? Would you have preferred more or less time to research? -- write down your answers somewhere
  4. adapt the routine -- change the time limit of research (initially try to double or half the time)
- note that over time you'll gain more knowledge in a particular area, which means you'll be able to work on more detailed/challenging problems -- this means that over time it will make sense to decrease the amount of research time as the processing will take longer

[reference](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/knowledge-cycle-efficiently-organize-writing-projects/)

## Create Zettel from Reading Notes

- the process of taking notes while you read can be done either in a notebook, or on a computer
  - using a notebook has the downside of needing to enter the notes into your computer manually afterwards
  - taking notes on your computer as you read can interrupt the flow of reading
  - choice is personal preference
- There are 3 phases that can be used to translate your notes into Zettel:
  1. Pull the notes -- note that the order of your notes shouldn't make a significant difference if they are written correctly
  2. form clusters and create overviews -- form a plan by asking yourself, "what was my reading intent and how can I best capture it?"
     1. depending on the book, sketching a rough mind map could be helpful
     2. clusters don't have to follow the outline of the book (could instead be topic based, similar to the index)
  3. Write notes about clusters -- you can repeat the following routine:
     1. start with a note that is as general as possible (1 for each cluster)
     2. get to the details in additional notes as needed -- atomicity of concepts is key
     3. feed everything you found out in step 2 back into the overview of step 1 (be as concise as possible)
- Can start by trying to grasp an entire cluster in a single note -- you can then try to find out if a cluster's main point has too many prerequisites to stand by itself (i.e. a conclusion that depends on many assumptions)
- Atomicity of notes makes it possible to re-use arguments/assumptions/notes in general, which multiplies the number of connections in your zettelkasten
